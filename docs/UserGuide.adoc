== Introduction

*Know-It-All* is a flashcard application that helps users store and organise their learning material. With an easy to use interface and a storage solution that supports content sharing, *Know-It-All* is designed to help students perform rote learning more efficiently. From cramming in between lessons to focused study, the in-built test session boosts the effectiveness of repetition and recall for memorisation. *Know-It-All* targets medicine students as their studies involve a considerable amount of memory work, and deals with content that is suitable for the bite-sized flashcard format.

== About

[[Features]]
== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Commands are written in monospaced font, e.g. `sort`
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `addfolder FOLDER_NAME`, `FOLDER_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add Human Anatomy`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g HINTS in `add q/QUESTION a/ANSWER [h/HINTS]`.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `q/QUESTION a/ANSWER`, `a/ANSWER q/QUESTION` is also acceptable.
====

=== Card Operations
Commands listed in this section affect the <<flashcard, flashcards>> within a single <<folder, folder>>.

[NOTE]
The commands in this section can only be executed when the user is within a folder

==== Adding a flashcard : `add`

Adds a flashcard to the current folder. Know-It-All supports 2 types of flashcards: **Single answer cards** and **MCQ** cards.

Format **(Single answer)**: `add q/QUESTION a/ANSWER [h/HINT]` +
Format **(MCQ)**: `add q/QUESTION a/ANSWER [i/INCORRECT_OPTION]... [h/HINT]`

====
* A card can have at most 1 hint (including 0)
* A card can have any number of incorrect options to denote an MCQ card
* A card with 0 incorrect options will automatically be denoted as a Single answer card
====

Examples:

* `add q/Hello? a/World`
* `add q/The cat ___ on the mat a/sat h/poetry`
* `add q/What is the powerhouse of the cell? a/mitochondria i/cell wall i/nucleus h/biology`


==== Editing a flashcard : `edit`

Edits the flashcard specified by the <<index, index>> in the current folder.

Format: `edit i/INDEX [q/QUESTION] [a/ANSWER] [h/HINT]`

====
* Edits the card at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed card list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* **(MCQ cards)** When editing incorrect options, the existing incorrect options of the card will be removed i.e adding of options is not cumulative.
* You can remove the card's hint by typing `h/` without specifying any hint after it.
====

Examples:

* `edit 1 a/Skin h/` +
Edits the answer of the 1st card to be 'Skin' and removes the hint associated, if any.
* `edit 2 h/history q/Who discovered Penicillin? a/Alexander Fleming` +
Edits the hint, question and answer of the 2nd card respectively.


==== Selecting a flashcard : `select`

Displays flashcard details (question, answer, hint, card score) on the right panel on selection by index.

Format: `select INDEX`

Examples:

* `list` +
`select 2` +
Selects the 2nd card in the current folder

==== Deleting a flashcard : `delete`

Deletes the flashcard identified by index from the current folder.

Format: `delete INDEX`

====
* Deletes the card at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed card list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
====

* `list` +
`delete 2` +
Deletes the 2nd card in the address book.

//tag::sortcommand[]
==== Sort flashcards by score within a folder : `sort`

Displays all flashcards sorted such that the lowest <<cardscore, card scores>> are at the top temporarily.

Format: `sort`
//end::sortcommand[]

==== Search by keywords : `search`

Within a folder, searches for flashcards inside the current folder using keywords in flashcard questions.

Format: `search KEYWORDS [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

==== List flashcards : `list`

Display a list of the flashcards in the current folder, where only questions can be seen, answers are hidden.

Format: `list`

====
* This command is implicitly invoked upon entering a folder, and can be used to reset the view after search or sort.
====

// tag::undoredo[]
==== Undoing previous command : `undo`

Restores the cards in a particular card folder to the state before the previous _undoable_ command was executed.

Format: `undo`

====
* This command is performed with respect to the present folder you are in. For example, if you perform an `add` operation in folder A and enter folder B, invoking the `undo` command will undo the previous _undoable_ command performed in folder B and not the aforementioned `add` operation.
====

[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands: commands that modify a card folder's content (`add`, `delete` and `edit`).
====

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`list` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

* `select 1` +
`list` +
`undo` +
The `undo` command fails as there are no undoable commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

==== Redoing the previously undone command : `redo`

Reverses the most recent `undo` command performed in a folder.

Format: `redo`

====
* As with the `undo` command, this command is performed with respect to the present folder you are in. For example, if you perform an `undo` operation in folder A and enter folder B, invoking the `redo` command will redo the previous `undo` command performed in folder B and not the one in folder A.
====

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +

* `delete 1` +
`redo` +
The `redo` command fails as there are no `undo` commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `clear` command) +
// end::undoredo[]


==== Exit folder : `change ..`

Return to the root directory (exit the current folder). A list of folders will be displayed

Format: `change ..`

Examples:

* `change 2` +
`change ..` +
The first command enters the second folder in the folder list on the <<homedirectory, home directory>>. The second command then returns you back to the home directory by exiting the folder.


//tag::folderoperations[]
=== Folder Operations
Commands listed in this section affect the application and not a single folder.

[NOTE]
The commands in this section can only be executed when you are at the home directory, outside of any folder

==== Create new folder : `addfolder`

Creates a new flashcard folder with the specified name.

Format: `addfolder FOLDER_NAME`

====
* The newly created folder will not contain any cards.
* Folder names must be unique and non-blank. Attempting to add a folder with the same name as an existing folder will result in an error.
* Each folder and its cards are stored independently in the directory specified in `preferences.json`. By default, this is the `data/` directory.
====

Examples:

* `addfolder Nervous System` +
Creates a folder with the name "Nervous System". The user can then enter the folder with the `change` command and begin adding cards.

==== Remove folder : `deletefolder`

Removes the flashcard folder specified by index.

Format: `deletefolder FOLDER_INDEX`

====
* When a folder is deleted, all its cards are removed as well.
====

Examples:

* `deletefolder 2` +
Deletes the second folder in the folder list, along with its cards, on the home directory.

==== Rename folder : `editfolder`

Renames the flashcard folder specified by index.

Format: `editfolder FOLDER_INDEX NEW_FOLDER_NAME`

====
* The new name of the folder cannot be the same as an existing folder.
====

Examples:

* `editfolder 2 Circulatory System` +
Renames the second folder in the folder list to "Circulatory System".

==== Enter folder : `change`

Enters the folder specified by index. Panel on the left will display the list of cards in that folder.

Format: `change FOLDER_INDEX`

Examples:

* `change 2` +
Enters the second folder in the folder list on the home directory.

**Merge folders feature** `Coming in v2.0`

This feature will enable users to join multiple folders together, reducing the number of folders and grouping two topics.

Format: `merge FOLDER_INDEX_1 FOLDER_INDEX_1 NEW_FOLDER_NAME`

==== Import flashcards : `import`

Searches for a csv file in the root project directory and parses the file to generate a flashcard folder.

NOTE: The csv file imported should follow the format below



Format: `import FILENAME`

==== Export flashcards : `export`

Creates a csv file containing the flashcards from the specified folder, which can later be imported.
Exported card folder will be created in the project root directory.

Format: `export FOLDER_INDEX FILENAME [MORE_INDEXES]`

//end::folderoperations[]

//tag::testoperations[]
=== Test Operations
After memorising the content of the flashcards, it is helpful to test how much information have been internalised and retained in a timed setting. The following commands show just how this can be done with the <<testsession, Test Session>> functionality of *Know-It-All*.

==== Test flashcards in a folder : `test`

This command begins a test session, where the display area enters a fullscreen (see Figure 1 below).

.A successful test command will display a test session page
image::startTestSessionPage.png[width="790"]

{empty} +
Format: `test`

[NOTE]
This command is only considered valid when inside the folder to be tested and is not already inside a test session.

====
* Only questions and hints are presented and users are required to either input an attempt or enter the command to
reveal the answer.
* (**MCQ cards**) the ordering of options will be randomized each time the card is tested.
* Internally, flashcards in a folder are queued to be displayed one by one in the order of lowest existing score to highest existing score.
* The next card will only be presented when the next command is carried out.
====


Examples:

* `test` +
Starts a session by displaying a flashcard (both question and hint) from the current folder.

**Hint toggle on / off feature** `Coming in v2.0`

When extra help is needed and familiarity with the content is not yet established hints can be toggled on during a test session when a ‘-hint’ is added on at the end of the test command. Hint will be displayed along with the question when the card is presented.

Format: `test [-hint]`

**Timer feature** `Coming in v2.0`

If you are preparing for an exam that will require you to recall information quickly within the limited time given.
This timer feature is just right for you! You will be given only 20 seconds to answer each question. If the 20 seconds is up before the question is answered, this attempt will be marked as wrong.

Format: `test [-timer]`

==== Keying in answer to a flashcard: `ans`

To reinforce learning and enable a more engaging experience with Know-It-All, one can input an answer for the
currently displayed flashcard question. Know-It-All compares the attempt with the correct answer in that card and
shows if it is correct or wrong.

====
* Answering a flashcard will increase the total number of attempts. If the answer is correct, the action will also increase the number of correct attempts.
* Answer matching is case insensitive.
* To answer **MCQ cards**, enter the number of option that you think is correct, rather than the option itself. +
E.g. `ans 1` rather than `ans myanswer`
====

If the answer has been submitted successfully and it is wrong, you will see the following page (see Figure 2).

.Wrong Answer page
image::WrongAnswerPage.png[width="790"]

{empty} +
If the answer has been submitted successfully and it is correct, you will see the following page (see Figure 3).

.Correct Answer page
image::CorrectAnswerPage.png[width="790"]

{empty} +
Format: `ans ANSWER`

Examples:

* `ans Mitochondrion` +
in response to the card question: What is the powerhouse of the cell?

.Answering an MCQ card
image::AnsweringMcqCard.png[width="790"]

* `ans 4` +
in response to the card displayed in Figure 4, where choosing option 4 will give the right answer.

[NOTE]
This command is only considered valid if a card question is currently being
displayed in an active test session.


==== Reveal answer to a flashcard : `reveal` `Coming in v1.4`
Immediately reveals the correct answer. The user will not need attempt any answer before being presented the correct
answer.

Format: `reveal`

====
* This is equivalent to a wrong answer, so there is no addition to the correct attempts of this card.
====


[NOTE]
This command is only considered valid if a card question is currently being displayed in an active test session.

==== Go to next flashcard : `next`

Presents the next lowest score flashcard in this current test session. Upon a successful next command, you will see a
 similar page below (see Figure 4).

.Next card question displayed upon a successful next command
image::NextCommandPage.png[width="790"]

{empty} +
Format: `next`

[NOTE]
This command is only considered valid if a card question and answer is currently being displayed  (has already done answering the question or revealed the answer) in an active test session. In other words, a flashcard cannot be skipped.

[NOTE]
There is no backtracking in the current session so there is no `prev` command.

[[EndCommand]]
==== End the current test session : `end`

Quits the current test session.

Format: `end`
//end::testoperations[]

//tag::reportoperations[]
=== Report Operations
After testing, you can track your how you scored against previous attempts using our report feature. Because cards
about a particular topic are expected to be in the same folder, the <<folderscore, folder scores>> are tracked per folder.

==== Display a folder score report : `report`

Displays a full-screen <<folderscore, folder score>> report for the current folder.
The report comprises a graph showing the last 10 <<folderscore, folder scores>>,
the latest score change, and the top 3 lowest scoring cards and their individual <<cardscore, card scores>>.
An example is shown below:

.Report display
image::ReportDisplay.png[width="790"]

Format: `report`

[NOTE]
This command is only valid inside a folder.

[NOTE]
There must be at least two test attempts for a graph to be drawn.

==== End the current report session : `end`

Quits the current report session.

Format: `end`

//end::reportoperations[]

=== Global Operations
The commands shown in this section are applicable anywhere in the application.

==== Viewing help : `help`

Opens the User Guide in a new window.

Format: `help`

==== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`
