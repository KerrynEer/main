== Introduction

*Know-It-All* is a solution for those who find carrying physical flashcards around troublesome and prefer an application to help them store and organize their learning material. *Know-It-All*’s easy to use interface and digital storage allow users to effectively utilize intermittent breaks between lessons to cramp in that last bit of knowledge. *Know-It-All* is targeted at medicine students in NUS as their studies requires a considerable amount of memory work, and deals with content that is suitable for the bite-sized flashcard format.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `create f/FOLDER`, `FOLDER` is a parameter which can be used as `add f/Human Anatomy`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `i/INDEX [q/QUESTION] [a/ANSWER]` can be used as `i/1 q/Powerhouse of the cell a/Mitochondria` or as `i/1 q/Powerhouse of the cell`.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `q/QUESTION a/ANSWER`, `a/ANSWER q/QUESTION` is also acceptable.

=== Test flashcards in a folder : `test`

As medical students, loads of time are spent memorising the content of these flashcards. It is time to test how much information have been internalised and retained in a timed setting.

This command begins a test session, where the display area enters a fullscreen (see Fig 3.11). Only questions and hints are presented and users are required to either input an attempt or the command to reveal the answer within 20 seconds. When the 20 seconds is up before the question is answered, this attempt will be marked as wrong. Internally, flashcards in a folder are queued to be displayed one by one in the order of lowest existing score to highest existing score. The next card will only be presented when the next command is carried out.

Format: `test [FOLDER_INDEX]`

Examples:

* `test 1` +
Starts a session by displaying a flashcard (both question and hint) from the first folder where 20
seconds is given to each card to be answered.

**Hint Toggle On / Off Feature** `To be coming in v2.0`

When extra help is needed and familiarity with the content is not yet established, hints can be toggled on during a test session when a ‘-hint’ is added on at the end of the test command. Hint will be displayed along with the question when the card is presented.

Format: `test [FOLDER_INDEX] [-hint]`

==== Keying in answer to a flashcard: `ans`

To reinforce learning and enable a more engaging experience with Know-It-All, one can input an answer for the
currently displayed flashcard question. Know-It-All compares the attempt with the correct answer in that card and
shows if it is correct or wrong. +

The total number of attempts will be incremented. If the answer is correct, the
number of correct attempts will also be incremented of this card.

Format: `ans ANSWER`

Examples:

* `ans Mitochondrion` +
In response to the card question: What is the powerhouse of the cell?


[TIP]
Answer matching is case insensitive. +
This command is only considered valid if a card question is currently being
displayed in an active test session.


==== Reveal answer to a flashcard : `reveal`

As busy students, there is no need to wait for the full 20 seconds to be up to be presented with the correct answer.

See the answer to the currently displayed card without keying in any answer. This is equivalent to a wrong answer, so there is no addition to the correct attempts of this card.

Format: `reveal`

[TIP]
This command is only considered valid if a card question is currently being displayed in an active test session.

==== Go to next flashcard : `next`

Presents the next lowest score flashcard in this current test session and the 20 seconds starts running again before the answer is revealed.

Format: `next`

[TIP]
This command is only considered valid if a card question and answer is currently being displayed  (has already done answering the question or revealed the answer) in an active test session. In other words, a flashcard cannot be skipped.

[NOTE]
There is no backtracking in the current session so there is no `prev` command.


==== End the current session : `end`

Quits the current test session. +
Format: `end`

=== Sort cards by level within a folder : `sort`

Displays all flashcards sorted such that the lowest scoring cards are at the top temporarily. +
Format: `sort`

=== Search by keywords : `search`

At the root directory, searches for folders using keywords in folder names. Within a folder, user can search for flashcards inside the current folder using keywords in flashcard questions. +
Format: `search KEYWORDS [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

=== List flashcards : `list`

Display a list of the flashcards in the current folder, where only questions can be seen, answers are hidden. This command is implicitly invoked upon entering a folder, and can be used to reset the view after search or sort. +
Format: `list`

=== Import flashcards : `import`

Searches for a json file with the specified filename in the program directory and parses the file to generate a flashcard folder. +
Format: `import FILENAME`

=== Export flashcards : `export`

Creates a json file containing the flashcards from the specified folder, which can later be imported. +
Format: `export FOLDER_INDEX FILENAME`

=== Exiting the program : `exit`
