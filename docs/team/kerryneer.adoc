== About the project

I worked in a team of 5 for a software engineering project to morph a basic command line interface addressbook into a
flashcard management application called Know-It-All. Know-It-All is designed to help medical students store, organise
and share their learning material, integrated with a test session feature and scoring system to allow for a more efficient rote learning process.

My role was to design and implement the test session feature. The following sections illustrate this major feature in more detail.

Note the following icons and formatting used in this document:

`test`: A grey highlight (called a mark-up) indicates that this is a command to be executed or a component, class
or object in the architecture of the application.

== Summary of contributions
This section shows a summary of my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the team project.

*Major feature*: I implemented the functionalities of a test session.

* What it does: This allows users to  begin and end a test session. While inside a test session, flashcard questions
will be displayed, and student can input an answer or choose to reveal the answer before moving on to the next
flashcard.
* Justification: This feature is the main highlight of Know-It-All, as students use flashcards to test how
much content they have memorised. Equipped with the user-friendly answer command that is missing in existing
flashcard applications, Know-It-All provides a more engaging and interactive testing experience for the user.
* Highlights: This feature modifies the existing UI to facilitate the addition of a new test session screen. It also
has a heavy dependency on folder methods. Hence, this feature required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives,
considering design patterns and principles as well as the user-friendliness of the commands.
More details can be found under design considerations sections of <<contributionstodevguide>>.
Implementation and writing tests were also tedious as many checks of the current state of the test session needs to be
done to permit only certain commands and ban others.

*Code contributed*: [https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s2.github.io/cs2103-dashboard/#search=kerryneer[Collated code]]

*Other contributions*:

* Enhancements to features:
** Wrote additional tests for new features to increase coverage from 79% to 81% (Pull requests https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/pull/74[#74])
** Refactor existing status bar to display the current state of the user (whether user is in a test session, in a
report display, in a folder or in home directory) instead of the previous last saved location and time. Corresponding
 tests are written as well. (Pull requests https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/pull/162[#162])
** Updated UI colour scheme to enhance aesthetics and clarity of Know-It-All (Pull requests https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/pull/162[#162], https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/pull/166[#166],
https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/pull/174[#174])

* Documentation:
** User guide: I updated the QuickStart section, added new features, remove previous addressbook features and modify
existing commands (Pull requests https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/pull/60[#60], https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/pull/59[#59], https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/pull/80[#80],

** Developer guide: I updated relevant sections related to addressbook to our Know-It-All flashcard context
like Product scope and Non-Functional Requirements, some of its class diagrams and sequence diagrams, and added
implementation for test session (Pull requests https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/pull/80[#80],
https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/pull/106[#106])
** About Us page: I collated and updated profiles for all members of the team. (Pull requests https://github.com/cs2103-ay1819s2-w10-4/main/pull/6[#6],

== Contributions to the User Guide
We had to update the original addressbook User Guide with instructions for Know-It-All enhancements that we
had added. The following is an excerpt from our updated Know-It-All User Guide, showing a few of the notable additions that I have made for the test session feature.

=== Command Format
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you e.g. in `addfolder FOLDER_NAME`,
`FOLDER_NAME` is a parameter which can be something like `Human Anatomy`.

* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `HINTS` in `add q/QUESTION a/ANSWER [h/HINTS]`.

== Contributions to the Developer Guide
Besides updating the original addressbook User Guide, Developer Guide has to be updated to Know-It-All context and
features as well. To keep this section concise, I have included an excerpt from my contributions to the updated Know-It-All Developer Guide about the UI Component and the implementation details and design considerations for the test session feature.
