* This is a desktop Flash Card application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* Know-It-All is targeted at medical students in NUS (or any student!) as their studies requires a considerable amount of memory work, and deals with content that is suitable for the bite-sized flashcard format.
* You can manage your flash cards, test yourself, and even has a convenient way to share flash cards with your fellow classmates! What are you waiting for? Download Know-It-All today!
